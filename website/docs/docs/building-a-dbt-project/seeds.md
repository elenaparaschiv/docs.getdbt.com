## Getting started
<Callout type='info' title="Want to run through a tutorial?">
Check out [our lesson](tutorial/add-a-seed.md) on adding a seed file to your project.
</Callout>

Seeds are CSV files in your dbt project (typically in your `data` directory),
that dbt can load into your data warehouse using the `dbt seed` command.

Seeds can be referenced in downstream models the same way as referencing  using the `ref` function.

Because these CSV files are located in your dbt repository, they are version
controlled and code reviewable. Seeds are best suited to static data which
changes infrequently.

Good use-cases for seeds:
* A list of mappings of country codes to country names
* A list of test emails to exclude from analysis
* A list of employee account IDs

Poor use-cases of dbt seeds:
* Loading raw data uploaded to CSVs

## Example
To load a seed file in your dbt project:
1. Add the file to your `data` directory, with a `.csv` file extension, e.g. `data/country_codes.csv`

<File name='data/country_codes.csv'>

```text
country_code,country_name
US,United States
CA,Canada
GB,United Kingdom
...
```

</File>

2. Run the [dbt seed](link-to-nowhere) command â€” a new table will be created in your warehouse in your target schema, named `country_codes`
```
$ dbt seed

Found 2 models, 3 tests, 0 archives, 0 analyses, 53 macros, 0 operations, 1 seed file

14:46:16 |
14:46:16 | Finished running 1 seed in 0.14s.

Completed successfully

Done. PASS=1 ERROR=0 SKIP=0 TOTAL=1
```

3. Refer to seeds in downstream models using the `ref` function.

<File name='models/orders.csv'>

```sql
-- This refers to the table created from data/country_codes.csv
select * from {{ ref('country_codes') }}
```

</File>

* Can I use a format other than CSV (e.g. TSV)? No
* How do I escape comma characters?
* Can I name my table a different name to the CSV file? Umm I think aliases apply, but, like, why would you tho?
* Can I run models downstream of a seed? Yes, use the model selection syntax
* My seed was loaded with the wrong datatype. Can I force a datatype?
* Do hooks run when running seeds?
* Can I load one seed a time? Yes in v0.16.0
